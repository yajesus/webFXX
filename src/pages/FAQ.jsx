              Orders are seamlessly assigned to your Workbench account by the
              system, determined by your agent level. The product's price is
              based on the Workbench wallet balance, which remains unless
              specific events necessitate adjustments. To optimize a product,
              navigate to "STARTING", click on "START NOW", and then submit your
              optimization.

              Our Workbench is intricately synchronized with the shopping mall's
              ERP systems. Orders are treated as return products, and the system

              effort.

              We prioritize the security of any private information entrusted to

              against using sensitive details such as birthdays, ID numbers, or

            </h3>
            <p class=" font-bold ml-6">
              In the event of the company terminating your contract, it assumes
              responsibility and ensures payment of wages and earned
              commissions. However, if you choose to terminate the contract for
              personal reasons, the company is not obligated to make any
              payments.
